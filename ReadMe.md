## Introduction

The type of representation of data that has geographical factors in it is known as geospatial data. Visualizing such kind of geospatial data is known as geospatial visualization. Most current visualization techniques focus on representing each factor of such data using single-dimensional shapes called glyphs. Glyphs, sometimes called icons, are graphic objects that use size, shape, and colour to represent one or more data values.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this study is to determine the number of visual encodings that can be placed on a glyph to aid in the sensemaking process. To do this, we conducted a case study using car accident data from the United States, and parameters such as time of day, accident severity, and weather condition are represented as glyphs on the geospatial map. The case study intends to help the corresponding government authorities identify the reasons that cause accidents, allowing them to gain insights into how to prevent such situations in the future.

## Implementation

The goal of the visualization is to plot multiple visual encodings using different visual encodings using a glyph on a choropleth. The primary layer in our visualization is the choropleth, representing a color gradient of the frequency variation across all the states. The glyphs are mostly objects and can be represented using any shape and color. In our project, we considered visual elements such as circles, bar graphs, pie charts and shapes such as clouds, snow, etc.

## Usage

Instructions on how to use my project.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have Tableau Desktop installed on your machine. If you don't have it, you can download and install it from the Tableau website.

### Downloading the Tableau File

- Go to the repository's "Code File" directory where the Tableau file is stored.
- Download the Tableau file (IV_ProjDashboard.twb).

### Opening the Tableau File

- Locate the downloaded Tableau file on your machine.
- Double-click the file to open it in Tableau Desktop.

### Exploring the Choropleth Map Visualization

- Once the Tableau file is open, you should see the data visualization on the choropleth map.
- Interact with the visualization by selecting different glyphs, zooming in/out, or hovering over map regions to view additional information.
